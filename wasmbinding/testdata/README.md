# Stub test contract

This folder contains bogus test contract which just exposes public api from
example contract in the babylon bindings repo - https://github.com/babylonchain/bindings/tree/main/contracts/example

This approach enables us to specify which branch from bindings library we want to test/use.

Until custom babylon api is stable this approach enables faster iteration than publishing
WASM blobs from bindings library directly.

## Artifacts

We are storing current version of artifacts in repo to speed up the CI.
In principle we could use rust-optimizer in each run to build contract from sources but it would take longer
time.
Downside of this approach is that with each update of `Cargo.toml` or `lib.rs` file
WASM blobs should be regenerated by running `make build-test-WASM` command
