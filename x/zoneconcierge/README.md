# ZoneConcierge

The Zone Concierge module is responsible for providing BTC staking integration
functionalities for Bitcoin Supercharged Networks (BSNs) connecting  
to Babylon Genesis through IBC. It leverages the IBC protocol to receive BSNs'
headers, and propagate BTC timestamps of those headers and information
associated with the BTC staking protocol (e.g., finality providers, BTC stakes,
and more).  
The Zone Concierge module synchronises the following information with BSNs (aka
consumers) via IBC packets:

- **BTC Headers:** Babylon Genesis forwards the BTC headers maintained by its
  BTC light client to BSNs.  
  This allows BSNs to maintain an image of the Bitcoin chain and verify
  information included in it through inclusion proofs (e.g., an inclusion
  proof of a BTC Timestamp containing BSN headers).
- **BTC Timestamps:** When a Babylon Genesis epoch is finalized, the Babylon
  Genesis chain sends BTC timestamps to BSNs. Each BTC timestamp contains:
  - The latest BSN header that was checkpointed in the finalised epoch
  - Recent BTC headers that extend the BSN's BTC light client
  - The finalised epoch's metadata and raw checkpoint
  - Proofs that a BSN header was included in an epoch and the epoch was
  timestamped on the Bitcoin chain.
- **BTC Staking:** Babylon Genesis enables trustless Bitcoin staking for BSNs by
  synchronising staking-related information between Bitcoin, Babylon Genesis and
  BSNs. This allows BTC holders to stake their BTC to secure BSNs without
  requiring any custodial solutions.

## State

The Zone Concierge module keeps handling IBC headers of PoS systems, and
maintains the following KV stores.

### Parameters

The [parameter storage](./keeper/params.go) maintains the Zone Concierge
module's parameters. The Zone Concierge module's parameters are represented as a
`Params` [object](../../proto/babylon/zoneconcierge/v1/params.proto) defined as
follows:

```protobuf
// Params defines the parameters for the module.
message Params {
  option (gogoproto.equal) = true;
  
  // ibc_packet_timeout_seconds is the time period after which an unrelayed 
  // IBC packet becomes timeout, measured in seconds
  uint32 ibc_packet_timeout_seconds = 1
      [ (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"ibc_packet_timeout_seconds\"" ];
}
```

### ChainInfo

The [chain info storage](./keeper/chain_info_indexer.go) maintains `ChainInfo`
for each PoS system. The key is the PoS system's `ConsumerID`, which is the ID
of the IBC light client. The value is a `ChainInfo` object. The `ChainInfo` is a
structure storing the information of a PoS system that checkpoints to Babylon
Genesis.

```protobuf
// ChainInfo is the information of a Consumer
message ChainInfo {
  // consumer_id is the ID of the consumer
  string consumer_id = 1;
  // latest_header is the latest header in the Consumer's canonical chain
  IndexedHeader latest_header = 2;
  // latest_forks is the latest forks, formed as a series of IndexedHeader (from
  // low to high)
  Forks latest_forks = 3;
  // timestamped_headers_count is the number of timestamped headers in the Consumer's
  // canonical chain
  uint64 timestamped_headers_count = 4;
}
```

### EpochChainInfo

The [epoch chain info storage](./keeper/epoch_chain_info_indexer.go) maintains
`ChainInfo` at the end of each Babylon epoch for each PoS system. The key is the
PoS system's `ConsumerID` plus the epoch number, and the value is a `ChainInfo`
object.

### CanonicalChain

The [canonical chain storage](./keeper/canonical_chain_indexer.go) maintains the
metadata of canonical IBC headers of a PoS system. The key is the BSN's
`ConsumerID` plus the height, and the value is a `IndexedHeader` object.
`IndexedHeader` is a structure storing IBC header's metadata.

```protobuf
// IndexedHeader is the metadata of a Consumer header
message IndexedHeader {
  // consumer_id is the unique ID of the consumer
  string consumer_id = 1;
  // hash is the hash of this header
  bytes hash = 2;
  // height is the height of this header on the Consumer's ledger
  // (hash, height) jointly provides the position of the header on the Consumer's ledger
  uint64 height = 3;
  // time is the timestamp of this header on the Consumer's ledger.
  // It is needed for the Consumer to unbond all mature validators/delegations
  // before this timestamp when this header is BTC-finalised
  google.protobuf.Timestamp time = 4 [ (gogoproto.stdtime) = true ];
  // babylon_header_hash is the hash of the babylon block that includes this
  // Consumer header
  bytes babylon_header_hash = 5;
  // babylon_header_height is the height of the babylon block that includes this
  // Consumer header
  uint64 babylon_header_height = 6;
  // epoch is the epoch number of this header on Babylon ledger
  uint64 babylon_epoch = 7;
  // babylon_tx_hash is the hash of the tx that includes this header
  // (babylon_block_height, babylon_tx_hash) jointly provides the position of
  // the header on Babylon ledger
  bytes babylon_tx_hash = 8;
}
```

### Fork

The [fork storage](./keeper/fork_indexer.go) maintains the metadata of canonical
IBC headers of a PoS system. The key is the PoS system's `ConsumerID` plus the
height, and the value is a list of `IndexedHeader` objects, which represent fork
headers at that height.

### Params

The [parameter storage](./keeper/params.go) maintains the parameters for the
Zone Concierge module.

```protobuf
// Params defines the parameters for the module.
message Params {
  option (gogoproto.equal) = true;
  
  // ibc_packet_timeout_seconds is the time period after which an unrelayed 
  // IBC packet becomes timeout, measured in seconds
  uint32 ibc_packet_timeout_seconds = 1
      [ (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"ibc_packet_timeout_seconds\"" ];
}
```

### Port

The [port storage](./keeper/keeper.go) maintains the port ID for the Zone
Concierge module. The key is `PortKey` and the value is the port ID string.

### LastSentBTCSegment

The [last sent BTC segment storage](./keeper/epochs.go) maintains information
about the last BTC chain segment that was broadcast to other light clients. The
key is `LastSentBTCSegmentKey` and the value is a `BTCChainSegment` object,
defined as follows.

```protobuf
// Btc light client chain segment grown during last finalized epoch
message BTCChainSegment {
  repeated babylon.btclightclient.v1.BTCHeaderInfo btc_headers = 1;
}
```

### SealedEpochProof

The [sealed epoch proof storage](./keeper/epochs.go) maintains proofs that
epochs were properly sealed. The key is `SealedEpochProofKey` plus the epoch
number, and the value is a `ProofEpochSealed` object.

## PostHandler for intercepting IBC headers

The Zone Concierge module implements a
[PostHandler](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/advanced/baseapp#runtx-antehandler-runmsgs-posthandler)
`IBCHeaderDecorator` to intercept headers sent to the [IBC client
module](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/v8.0.0/modules/core/02-client).
The `IBCHeaderDecorator` PostHandler is defined at
[x/zoneconcierge/keeper/ibc_header_decorator.go](./keeper/ibc_header_decorator.go).

For each IBC client update message in the transaction, the `PostHandler`
executes as follows:

1. Extract the header info and the client state from the message
2. Determine if the header is on a fork by checking if the client is frozen
3. Call `HandleHeaderWithValidCommit` to process the header
4. If the PoS system hosting the header is not known to Babylon Genesis,
   initialize `ChainInfo` storage for the PoS system
5. If the header is on a fork, insert the header to the fork storage and update
   `ChainInfo`
6. If the header is canonical, insert the header to the canonical chain storage
   and update `ChainInfo`
7. Unfreeze the client if it was frozen due to a fork header

## Hooks

The Zone Concierge module subscribes to the Epoching module's `AfterEpochEnds`
[hook](../epoching/types/hooks.go) for indexing the epochs when receiving
headers from BSNs, the Checkpointing module's `AfterRawCheckpointSealed`
[hook](../checkpointing/types/hooks.go) for recording epoch chain info proofs,
and the Checkpointing module's `AfterRawCheckpointFinalized`
[hook](../checkpointing/types/hooks.go) for sending BTC timestamps to BSNs.

### Indexing headers upon `AfterEpochEnds`

The `AfterEpochEnds` hook is triggered when an epoch is ended, i.e., the last
block in this epoch has been committed by CometBFT. Upon `AfterEpochEnds`, the
Zone Concierge will save the current `ChainInfo` to the `EpochChainInfo` storage
for each BSN.

### Recording proofs upon `AfterRawCheckpointSealed`

The `AfterRawCheckpointSealed` hook is triggered when an epoch's raw checkpoint
is sealed by validator signatures. Upon `AfterRawCheckpointSealed`, the Zone
Concierge will:

1. Record epoch chain info with inclusion proofs for each BSN
2. Generate and store the proof that the epoch is sealed

### Sending BTC timestamps upon `AfterRawCheckpointFinalized`

The `AfterRawCheckpointFinalized` hook is triggered upon a checkpoint becoming
*finalised*, i.e., Bitcoin transactions of the checkpoint become `w`-deep in
Bitcoin's canonical chain, where `w` is the `checkpoint_finalization_timeout`
[parameter](../../proto/babylon/btccheckpoint/v1/params.proto) in the
[BTCCheckpoint module](../btccheckpoint/).

The [BTCTimestamp](../../proto/babylon/zoneconcierge/v1/packet.proto) structure  
includes a header and a set of proofs that the header is checkpointed by
Bitcoin.

<!-- TODO: diagram depicting BTC timestamp -->

```protobuf
// BTCTimestamp is a BTC timestamp that carries information of a BTC-finalized epoch
// It includes a number of BTC headers, a raw checkpoint, an epoch metadata, and 
// a Consumer header if there exists Consumer headers checkpointed to this epoch.
// Upon a newly finalized epoch in Babylon, Babylon will send a BTC timestamp to each
// PoS blockchain that has phase-2 integration with Babylon via IBC.
message BTCTimestamp {
  // header is the last Consumer header in the finalized Babylon epoch
  babylon.zoneconcierge.v1.IndexedHeader header = 1;

  /*
    Data for BTC light client
  */
  // btc_headers is BTC headers between
  // - the block AFTER the common ancestor of BTC tip at epoch `lastFinalizedEpoch-1` and BTC tip at epoch `lastFinalizedEpoch`
  // - BTC tip at epoch `lastFinalizedEpoch`
  // where `lastFinalizedEpoch` is the last finalized epoch in Babylon
  repeated babylon.btclightclient.v1.BTCHeaderInfo btc_headers = 2;

  /*
    Data for Babylon epoch chain
  */
  // epoch_info is the metadata of the sealed epoch
  babylon.epoching.v1.Epoch epoch_info = 3;
  // raw_checkpoint is the raw checkpoint that seals this epoch
  babylon.checkpointing.v1.RawCheckpoint raw_checkpoint = 4;
  // btc_submission_key is position of two BTC txs that include the raw checkpoint of this epoch
  babylon.btccheckpoint.v1.SubmissionKey btc_submission_key = 5;

  /* 
    Proofs that the header is finalized
  */
  babylon.zoneconcierge.v1.ProofFinalizedChainInfo proof = 6;
}

// ProofFinalizedChainInfo is a set of proofs that attest a chain info is
// BTC-finalized
message ProofFinalizedChainInfo {
  /*
    The following fields include proofs that attest the chain info is
    BTC-finalized
  */
  // proof_consumer_header_in_epoch is the proof that the Consumer header is timestamped
  // within a certain epoch
  tendermint.crypto.ProofOps proof_consumer_header_in_epoch = 1;
  // proof_epoch_sealed is the proof that the epoch is sealed
  babylon.zoneconcierge.v1.ProofEpochSealed proof_epoch_sealed = 2;
  // proof_epoch_submitted is the proof that the epoch's checkpoint is included
  // in BTC ledger It is the two TransactionInfo in the best (i.e., earliest)
  // checkpoint submission
  repeated babylon.btccheckpoint.v1.TransactionInfo proof_epoch_submitted = 3;
}
```

When `AfterRawCheckpointFinalized` is triggered, the Zone Concierge module will
send an IBC packet including a `BTCTimestamp` to each BSN. The logic is defined
at [x/zoneconcierge/keeper/hooks.go](./keeper/hooks.go) and works as follows:

1. **Determine BTC headers to broadcast**: Get all BTC headers to be sent in BTC
   timestamps by:
   - Finding the segment of BTC headers sent upon the last time
     `AfterRawCheckpointFinalized` was triggered
   - If all BTC headers in the segment are no longer canonical (due to a Bitcoin
     reorg), send the last `w+1` BTC headers from the current tip, where `w` is
     the `checkpoint_finalization_timeout`
     [parameter](../../proto/babylon/btccheckpoint/v1/params.proto) in the
     [BTCCheckpoint module](../btccheckpoint/)
   - Otherwise, send BTC headers from the latest header that is still canonical
     in the segment to the current tip of the BTC light client

2. **Broadcast BTC timestamps to all open channels**: For each open IBC channel
   with Babylon Genesis' Zone Concierge module:
   - Find the `ConsumerID` of the counterparty chain (i.e., the PoS system) in
     the IBC channel
   - Get the `ChainInfo` of the `ConsumerID` at the last finalised epoch
   - Get the metadata of the last finalised epoch and its corresponding raw
     checkpoint
   - Generate the proof that the last PoS system's canonical header is committed
     to the epoch's metadata (if applicable)
   - Generate the proof that the epoch is sealed, i.e., receives a BLS
     multisignature generated by validators with >2/3 total voting power at the
     last finalised epoch
   - Generate the proof that the epoch's checkpoint is submitted, i.e., encoded
     in transactions on Bitcoin
   - Assemble all the above and the BTC headers obtained in step 1 as
     `BTCTimestamp`, and send it to the IBC channel in an IBC packet

3. **Update last sent segment**: If headers were broadcast, update the last sent
   BTC segment for future reference

## EndBlocker

The Zone Concierge module implements an `EndBlocker` function that is executed
at the end of every block. The `EndBlocker` is defined at
[x/zoneconcierge/abci.go](./abci.go), and broadcasts BTC headers and BTC staking
related events.

### Broadcasting BTC Headers

The `EndBlocker` calls `BroadcastBTCHeaders` to send BTC headers to all open IBC
channels with BSNs. This ensures that BSNs' BTC light clients stay synchronized
with Babylon Genesis' BTC light client.

The header selection logic follows the same rules as described in the [Hooks
section](#sending-btc-timestamps-upon-afterrawcheckpointfinalized):

- If no headers have been sent previously: Send the last `w+1` BTC headers from
  the tip
- If headers have been sent previously:
  - If the last sent segment is still valid (no Bitcoin reorg): Send headers
    from the last sent header to the current tip
  - If the last sent segment is invalid (Bitcoin reorg occurred): Send the last
    `w+1` headers from the current tip

### Broadcasting BTC Staking Events

After broadcasting BTC headers, the `EndBlocker` calls
`BroadcastBTCStakingConsumerEvents` to propagate BTC staking events to relevant
BSNs. This function handles the distribution of BTC staking-related events that
need to be communicated to BSNs. The process works as follows:

1. **Getting events**: Gets all pending events from `x/btcstaking` module's
   store

2. **Channel Mapping**: For each BSN that has events:
  - Retrieves all open IBC channels connected to that BSN's port
  - Maps the consumer ID (a BSN's identifier) to its corresponding active
    channels

3. **Event Distribution**:
   - Groups events by consumer ID
   - For each BSN:
     - Assembles its relevant events into an IBC packet
     - Sends the packet to the IBC channel with that BSN

4. **Cleanup and State Management**:
   - After successful transmission, removes sent events from the pending queue
   - Updates relevant indices and counters

This process ensures that all BTC staking events are reliably propagated to the
corresponding BSNs, maintaining consistency across the network and enabling
proper operation of the BTC staking system.

## Handling Inbound IBC Packets

The Zone Concierge module implements the `OnRecvPacket` function to handle
incoming IBC packets from BSNs. The packet handling is defined at
[x/zoneconcierge/module_ibc.go](./module_ibc.go) and processes different types
of inbound packets.

### Inbound IBC Packets

The [inbound packet structure](proto/babylon/zoneconcierge/v1/packet.proto) is
defined as follows. Currently, the Zone Concierge module handles one type of
incoming packet: `ConsumerSlashingIBCPacket`. This packet type allows BSNs to
report slashing evidence for finality providers.

```protobuf
// InboundPacket represents packets received by Babylon from other chains
message InboundPacket {
  // packet is the actual message carried in the IBC packet
  oneof packet {
    ConsumerSlashingIBCPacket consumer_slashing = 1;
  }
}

// ConsumerSlashingIBCPacket defines the slashing information that a Consumer sends to Babylon's ZoneConcierge upon a
// Consumer slashing event.
// It includes the FP public key, the Consumer block height at the slashing event, and the double sign evidence.
message ConsumerSlashingIBCPacket {
  /// evidence is the FP slashing evidence that the Consumer sends to Babylon
  babylon.finality.v1.Evidence evidence = 1;
}
```

### Processing Inbound IBC Packets

The `HandleConsumerSlashing` function (called upon
[OnRecvPacket](x/zoneconcierge/module_ibc.go)) processes slashing reports
received from BSNs through IBC packets, with the following workflow:

1. **Verifying Evidence**:
   - Validates that slashing evidence is present and well-formed
   - Extracts the BTC secret key from the evidence
   - Verifies that the finality provider's BTC public key matches the evidence
2. **Slashing Execution**:
   - Updates the BSN finality provider's slashed status
   - Sends power distribution update events to adjust the Babylon Genesis
     finality provider's voting power (necessary because all BTC stakes must
     delegate to a Babylon Genesis finality provider, so slashing affects their
     voting power)
   - Identifies all BTC delegations associated with the slashed finality
     provider
   - Identifies all affected BSNs, where "affected" means there exists a slashed
     BTC delegation that multi-stakes to a finality provider in this BSN
   - Creates slashed BTC delegation events for each affected BSN
   - Propagates the slashing event to each BSN such that the BSN will update the
     status of affected BTC delegations and update the voting power of affected
     BSN finality providers. (Note: The propagation timing depends on the IBC
     relayer's operation schedule and is not under direct control of this
     module)
3. **Event Emission**: Emits a `EventSlashedFinalityProvider` event for external
   slashing mechanisms (e.g., BTC slasher/vigilante)

## Messages and Queries

The Zone Concierge module only has one message `MsgUpdateParams` for updating
the module parameters via a governance proposal.

It provides a set of queries about the status of checkpointed PoS systems,
listed at
[docs.babylonlabs.io](https://docs.babylonlabs.io/docs/developer-guides/grpcrestapi#tag/ZoneConcierge).

## BSN Integration

The Zone Concierge module connects Babylon Genesis and BSNs, relaying three
types of information through IBC: BTC headers, BTC timestamps, and BTC staking
events.

### IBC Communication Protocol

| Configuration Type | Value |
|-------------------|--------|
| Port | `zoneconcierge` |
| Ordering | `ORDERED` |
| Version | `zoneconcierge-1` |

| Packet Direction | Types |
|-----------------|-------|
| Outbound | `BTCHeaders`, `BTCTimestamp`, `BTCStakingConsumerEvent` |
| Inbound | `ConsumerSlashingIBCPacket` |

### Relaying BTC Headers

Zone Concierge relays BTC headers from Babylon Genesis' BTC light client to BSNs
in two scenarios:

1. When a new BTC timestamp is being sent (triggered by
   `AfterRawCheckpointFinalized`, see [Sending BTC
   Timestamps](#sending-btc-timestamps-upon-afterrawcheckpointfinalized))
2. Periodically via the `BroadcastBTCHeaders` function which is called upon
   `EndBlock`

This ensures BSNs can keep their BTC light clients synchronized with Bitcoin's
canonical chain. The headers are sent through IBC packets to all open channels
between Babylon and the BSNs.

### Relaying BTC Timestamps

Zone Concierge sends BTC timestamps to BSNs when a Babylon epoch becomes
BTC-finalised. The `AfterRawCheckpointFinalized` hook is triggered when an
epoch's checkpoint becomes `w`-deep in Bitcoin's canonical chain, which then
broadcasts `BTCTimestamp` packets to all open IBC channels.

Each `BTCTimestamp` includes:

- BTC headers to keep BSN light clients synchronised
- Epoch metadata and raw checkpoint
- Proofs that the epoch is finalized

The [Hooks section](#sending-btc-timestamps-upon-afterrawcheckpointfinalized)
provides details of assembling and broadcasting BTC timestamps.

### Relaying BTC Staking Events

Zone Concierge relays BTC staking events between Babylon Genesis and BSNs to
enable trustless BTC staking. The module handles:

- Broadcasting staking events to BSNs via `BroadcastBTCStakingConsumerEvents`
  during EndBlock
- Validating BSN registration during IBC channel creation
- Processing slashing reports from BSNs

See [EndBlocker](#endblocker) section for details on the event broadcasting
process.
