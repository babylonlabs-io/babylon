[Babylon](https://babylonlabs.io) provides a suite of security-sharing
protocols between Bitcoin and the PoS world. It provides two inter-connected
protocols:

- **Bitcoin timestamping:** Submits succinct and verifiable timestamps of any
  data (such as PoS blockchains) to Bitcoin.
- **Bitcoin staking:** Enables Bitcoin holders to provide economic security to
  any decentralized system through trustless (and self-custodian) staking.

## System requirements

This system spec has been tested by validators and found to be comfortable:

- Quad Core or larger AMD or Intel (amd64) CPU
- 32GB RAM
- 1TB NVMe Storage
- 100MBps bidirectional internet connection

You can run Babylon on lower-spec hardware for each component, but you may find
that it is not highly performant or prone to crashing.

## Build and install

To build and install, you need to have Go 1.23 available. Follow the
instructions on the [Golang page](https://go.dev/doc/install) to do that.

To build the binary:

```console
make build
```

The binary will then be available at `./build/babylond` .

To install the binary to system directories:

```console
make install
```
