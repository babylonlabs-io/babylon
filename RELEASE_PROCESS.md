This document outlines the release process for the Babylon node (babylond)

Babylon follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org), but with the
following deviations to account for state-machine and API breaking changes.

- State-machine breaking changes & API breaking changes will result in an
increase of the minor version Y (0.Y.z).
- All other changes will result in an increase of the patch version Z (0.y.Z).

## Breaking Changes

A change is considered to be ***state-machine breaking*** if it requires a
coordinated upgrade for the network to preserve state compatibility Note that
when bumping the dependencies of [Cosmos
SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and
[IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go), we will only treat patch releases as
non state-machine breaking.

A change is considered to be ***API breaking*** if it modifies the provided API.
This includes events, queries, CLI interfaces.

## Release Procedure

A _release_ is an increment of the second number (eg: `v0.1.0` → `v0.2.0`)

**Note**: Generally, PRs should target either `main` or a long-lived feature
branch (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)).

* Once the team feels that `main` is _**feature complete**_, we create a
  `release/v0.Y.x` branch (going forward known as release branch), where `Y` is
  the minor version number, with patch part substituted to `x` (eg: v0.11.x).
  * **PRs targeting directly a release branch can be merged _only_ when
    exceptional circumstances arise**.
* In the release branch
  * Create a PR that adds new version section in the `CHANGELOG.md`, matching the released version e.g
    for branch `release/v0.Y.x`, section will be called `v0.Y.0`
* We freeze the release branch from receiving any new features and focus on
  releasing a release candidate.
  * Finish audits and reviews.
  * Add more tests.
  * Fix bugs as they are discovered.
* After the team feels that the release branch works fine, we cut a release
  candidate.
  * Create a new annotated git tag for a release candidate in the release branch
    (follow the [Tagging Procedure](#tagging-procedure)).
  * The release verification on devnet must pass.
  * When bugs are found, create a PR for `main`, and backport fixes to the
    release branch.
  * Before tagging the release, create and merge PR to the release branch that:
    * Moves all changelog entries form `Unreleased` section of the changelog to the newly created section `v0.Y.0`
  * Create new release candidate tags after bugs are fixed.
* After the team feels the release candidate is ready, create a full release:
  * **Note:** The final release MUST have the same commit hash as the latest
    corresponding release candidate.
  * Create a new annotated git tag in the release branch (follow the [Tagging
    Procedure](#tagging-procedure))
* After the final release is made e.g `v0.Y.0`, backport changelog changes to the `main` branch
  * checkout a new branch from the main branch: `username/backport_changelog`
  * bring the new section from `release/v0.Y.x` branch to the `CHANGELOG.md` file on `main` branch
  * open PR against the `main` branch

### Creating a new release branch

- create a new release branch, e.g., `release/v0.10.x`
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull
    git checkout -b release/v0.10.x
    ```
- push the release branch upstream
    ```bash
    git push
    ```
### Cutting a new release

Before cutting a release (e.g., `v0.10.0-rc.0`), the
following steps are necessary:

- move to the release branch, e.g., `release/v0.10.x`
    ```bash
    git checkout release/v0.10.x
    ```
- create new tag (follow the [Tagging Procedure](#tagging-procedure))

### Tagging Procedure

**Important**: _**Always create tags from your local machine**_ since all
release tags should be signed and annotated. Using Github UI will create a
`lightweight` tag, so it's possible that `babylond version` returns a commit
hash, instead of a tag. This is important because most operators build from
source, and having incorrect information when you run `make install && babylond
version` raises confusion.

The following steps are the default for tagging a specific branch commit using
git on your local machine. Usually, release branches are labeled `release/v*`:

Ensure you have checked out the commit you wish to tag and then do (assuming
you want to release version `v0.10.0-rc.0` ):
```bash
git pull --tags

git tag -s -a v0.10.0-rc.0 -m "Version v0.10.0-rc.0"
```
## Patch Release Procedure

A _patch release_ is an increment of the patch number (eg: `v10.0.0` → `v10.0.1`).

**Important**: _**Patch releases can break consensus only in exceptional
circumstances .**_

Updates to the release branch should come from `main` by backporting PRs
(usually done by automatic cherry pick followed by a PRs to the release branch).
The backports must be marked using `backport/Y` label in PR for main.
It is the PR author's responsibility to fix merge conflicts and
ensure CI passes.

After the release branch has all commits required for the next patch release:
* Create a new annotated git tag in the release
branch (follow the [Tagging Procedure](#tagging-procedure)).
